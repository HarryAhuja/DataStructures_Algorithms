/*
 *  Using three hashSet for row,col,sub_box
 *  
 *  For row set, we want to reset it after each row
 *  so we use [r][c]
 *  
 *  For col set, we want to reset it after each col
 *  so we use [c][r]
 *  
 *  suppose window size is 3*3
 *  
 *  so divide the whole grid into these sub blocks
 *  each sub block will have its row index and col index(just like each cell within sub)
 *  
 *  To get row_index of sub_block(not cell)-> r/3
 *  To get col_index of sub_block(not cell)-> c/3
 *  
 *  Now we get to sub-block
 *  Now within sub-block, there are 3 rows and 3 cols
 *  to get row_of_cell_within_sub_block = r%3
 *  to get col_of_cell_within_sub_block = c%3
 *  
 *  So with this approach each sub-box will be identifed by sub_box_row, sub_box_col
 *  
 *  2nd approach
 *  
 *  Each sub box from L to R and then vertical will start its indexing from 0
 *  
 *  See copy
 *  
 *  one of the solution can be , in 9*9 grid, there are 9 sub boxes of 3*3 size
 *  so we can have array 9 hashsets, and depending upon the sub_box index,
 *  we can add and check in one of the 9 hashset
 *  
 *  or in java, instead of array of 9 hashset, hashmap where key represents
 *  sub_block_number(or row and col index of sub_block) and value represents
 *  hash set for that sub_block
 *  
 *  In this question, r and c have different meaning for row, col and subbox
 *  So calculation is done in that way
