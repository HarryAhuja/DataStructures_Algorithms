/*
 * "abcdbcbb";
 * 
 *  when i am at index=4(b), then if i b is repeating but if i just slide the window
 *  1 step(start a is removed), then b is still there which is hinder my requirement
 *  so i need to remove all chars till last seen b bcs i can't make unique substring
 *  with current b without removing all chars till last seen b(bcs its substring)
 *  I can't do just like this acdb
 *  
 *  So in hashmap store index where it was seen
 *  
 *  But just jumping start pointer will not be enough
 *  All chars till last seen b should also be removed from hashmap
 *  
 *  Alternatively
 *  abcdbapq
 *  
 *  when i am at second b
 *  dont remove "a" from hashmap, only update start.We will get out max right
 *  cdb
 *  now i am at second a-> I can include in this substring since my start=2 index
 *  but hashmap tells me that a is already there-> wrong info
 *  How could I differentiate these cases
 *  index of a last seen=0 < start
 *  start would remain same
 *  
 *  vbadba
 *  
 *  now start=2
 *  now at second a, last a seen=2
 *  so if its ==start, then start would become last seen+1
 *  
 *  vbpadba
 *  start=2
 *  last seen a = 3
 *  now its >start
 *  now start = last seen+ 1
 *  
 *  so from all these cases
 *  if(last_seen>=start)
 *  start = last_seen+1
 *  else
 *  start = start
 *  
 *  or 
 *  max(start,last_seen+1)
