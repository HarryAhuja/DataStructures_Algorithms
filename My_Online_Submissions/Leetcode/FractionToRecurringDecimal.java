/*
 * Divide until remainder is zero or remainder is repeating(then quotient will keep
 * on recurring)
 * 
 * 8/4 = 2
 * 37/2=18.5
 * 428/125=3.424
 * 14/3=4.66666.... = 4.(6)
 * 93/7 = 13.(285714) -> same remainder is seen when quotient was 13. and 13.285714
 * 
 * suppose divisor=3 and dividend=14
 * when first time remainder is 2,q was 4.
 * then we multiple 2 with 10=20 and 18 was subtracted-> so bcs of this 2(20), 6 was introduced
 * in q (4.6) -> so save all q which was appended after 2 was seen for first time
 * if 2 is seen again, all that saved q is repeating
 * 
 * In hashmap, save remainder against the q it was seen. It will help to define the opening
 * bracket
 * 
 * 2    ->  4.
 * 
 * q=4.6 
 * now 2 is again seen-> so put ( after mapping of 2 in hashmap) ->4.(6
 * closing after 2 is seen again -> 4.(6)
 * 
 * Algo
 * For one given num and den, if first remainder is zero then return quotient-> no need
 * of decimal
 * 
 * After we put dot-> only first time if need to add more than one zero, we put zero
 * also in q, otherwise after that as many as zeroes we can add in remainder
